## Method of Moments for X3
Given: <br />
• Sample file Teetertotter.txt
The mad, bad, and dangerous Dr. Otto von Teetertotter is experimenting with a new
distribution.

During his experiments in mad science, Dr. Teetertotter came up with three equations that
describe the population of the data set.

• The first equation 𝑚3 has a moment of 3.

𝑚3 = 𝐴B + 𝐴C − 20.08

• The second equation 𝑚2  has a moment of 2. And the derivative of the second moment
is the second sample moment and is equal to the variance of the dataset.

𝑚′2 = 2𝐶 + 5.2864

• The third equation 𝑚1 has a moment of 1, and it is equal to the mean of the dataset.

𝑚1 = 𝐴 + 𝐵 + 3.56

Find: <br />
• Show the mean of sample Teetertotter. <br />
• Show the variance of sample Teetertotter. <br />
• Show the 3rd moment of sample Teetertotter. <br />
• Solve for A, B, and C. <br />
